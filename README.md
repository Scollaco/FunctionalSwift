## FunctionalSwift

This repository contains Playground Pages used to show some concepts of Functional Programming in Swift. All the code and exercises are based on the book `Functional Programming in Scala` (https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala). It's a work in progress, but feel free to contribute and suggest improvements.
